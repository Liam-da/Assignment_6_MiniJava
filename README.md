Assignment 6a: We start by building an abstact syntax tree of the mini java progam and made sure to add the missing operators. 
We defined the types and evaluations for the unsupported operators Both unary and binary operators got added for both float and int. 
We created functions for the operators using lambda expressions, making sure the correct arguments and values were there. 
Creating a new construct to the tree, in which we have a statement and have two parameters. 
The new class we created can take any type of string and expression. 
We implementing the new class and made the visit() method take the new class

Assignment 6b:
Since Mini Java does not support boolean types, the condition is evaluated as an integer expression. 
The loop continues as long as the result of this expression is greater than or equal to zero.
We made a new whileloop that that takes two components: an expression and a statement.
We also made sure, the expression we use in ProgramTypeVisitor is of type int and added error messages.

The loop takes an integer, where we evaluate its conditions and get the value from the values-map.
